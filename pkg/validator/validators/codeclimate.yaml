# CodeClimate Reporter ID / Repo Token Validator
#
# NOTE: CodeClimate does not provide a dedicated API endpoint for validating
# test reporter tokens (CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID or CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN).
#
# These tokens are used to upload test coverage reports to:
# https://codeclimate.com/test_reports
#
# The only way to validate these tokens is to attempt an actual coverage upload,
# which is not practical for validation purposes.
#
# For API tokens (not reporter tokens), you can validate using:
# GET https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/user
# with header: Authorization: Token token={TOKEN}

  notes: |
    CodeClimate Reporter Tokens (CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID and CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN)
    are used exclusively for uploading test coverage data to CodeClimate.

    These tokens:
    - Are 64-character hexadecimal strings
    - Have write-only access for coverage data
    - Cannot be validated without attempting an actual coverage upload
    - Are scoped to a specific repository

    If you need to validate a CodeClimate API token (not a reporter token),
    use the CodeClimate API endpoint: GET /v1/user
